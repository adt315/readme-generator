# README Generator

The goal of this project was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The application is started by typing the following command in the terminal: node index.js

Here is a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the application's functionality and the typical user flow through the application:

This is a sample README generated by the application:
